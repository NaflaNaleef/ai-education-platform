## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Teacher Resource Upload

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/upload/resource`

**Process:**
- Teacher uploads a file (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- File is stored in Supabase Storage
- Resource metadata is saved to `resources` table
- File content is extracted for AI processing

**Request:**
```json
{
  "file": "File object",
  "title": "Photosynthesis Chapter",
  "description": "Chapter on plant photosynthesis process"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "resource": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "Photosynthesis Chapter",
    "file_url": "https://...",
    "file_type": "application/pdf",
    "upload_status": "ready"
  }
}
```

### 2. Complete Question Paper Creation

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/teacher/create-question-paper`

**Process:**
- AI analyzes uploaded content
- Generates questions based on content
- Creates intelligent marking scheme
- Saves everything to database

**Request:**
```json
{
  "resource_id": "uuid",
  "title": "Photosynthesis Quiz",
  "description": "Test your knowledge of photosynthesis",
  "question_count": 10,
  "difficulty_level": "medium",

{
  "success": true,
  "scheme": {
    "total_points": 25,
    "total_questions": 10,
    "criteria": [
      {
        "question_id": "q1",
        "grading_method": "exact_match",
        "keywords": ["photosynthesis", "sunlight", "chemical", "energy"],
        "partial_credit_rules": {
          "exact_match": true,
          "case_sensitive": false,
          "allow_partial": false
        },
        "ai_grading_prompt": "Grade this multiple choice answer..."
      }
    ],
