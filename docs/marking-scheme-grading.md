# AI-Powered Marking Scheme Grading Flow

## Overview

The grading system now uses **AI-generated marking schemes** that are created intelligently when questions are generated, and then used for consistent and fair grading. This provides the best of both worlds: AI intelligence for creating detailed grading criteria, and structured, consistent grading based on those criteria.

## New AI-Powered Grading Flow

### 1. AI-Generated Marking Scheme Creation
```
Content Upload → AI Analysis → Question Generation → AI Marking Scheme Creation → Database Storage
```

When questions are generated, AI automatically creates detailed marking schemes with:
- **Intelligent grading criteria** for each question
- **Keyword extraction** and analysis
- **Custom AI grading prompts** for complex questions
- **Partial credit rules** and feedback templates

### 2. AI-Enhanced Grading with Marking Schemes
```
Student Submission → Fetch AI Marking Scheme → Intelligent Grading → Results
```

The system uses AI-generated marking schemes to provide:
- **Multiple grading methods** (exact match, keyword match, AI-enhanced)
- **Consistent scoring** based on AI-analyzed criteria
- **Detailed feedback** using AI-generated templates
- **Fallback to direct AI grading** when needed

## AI Grading Methods

### 1. Exact Match (AI-Determined)
- **AI analyzes** question type and determines if exact matching is appropriate
- **Case-insensitive** matching for multiple choice questions
- **No partial credit** for wrong answers
- **Fast and efficient** grading

### 2. Keyword Match (AI-Extracted)
- **AI extracts** important keywords from correct answers
- **Intelligent keyword analysis** removes common words
- **Configurable thresholds** for partial credit
- **Detailed feedback** on missing keywords

### 3. AI-Enhanced Grading (Custom Prompts)
- **AI-generated prompts** specific to each question
- **Context-aware grading** using question details
- **Sophisticated feedback** generation
- **Fallback method** when other methods don't apply

## AI Marking Scheme Generation Process

### 1. Question Analysis
AI analyzes each question to determine:
- **Question type** and complexity
- **Key concepts** and terminology
- **Appropriate grading method**
- **Point allocation strategy**

### 2. Keyword Extraction
AI intelligently extracts keywords by:
- **Removing common words** (the, a, an, etc.)
- **Identifying key concepts** and terminology
- **Weighting important terms** appropriately
- **Creating comprehensive keyword lists**

### 3. Grading Criteria Creation
AI creates detailed criteria including:
- **Grading method selection** (exact_match, keyword_match, ai_enhanced)
- **Partial credit rules** and thresholds
- **Feedback templates** for different scenarios
- **Custom AI prompts** for complex grading

### 4. Validation and Enhancement
The system validates and enhances AI output:
- **Ensures all required fields** are present
- **Validates keyword lists** and criteria
- **Adds fallback options** for edge cases
- **Maintains consistency** across questions
